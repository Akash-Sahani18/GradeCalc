# 🎓 Java Grade Calculator

A **command-line Java application** that allows users to enter marks for three subjects (Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics), calculate total marks, average, percentage, and determine the **grade for each subject** as well as the **overall grade**.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Subject-wise grade calculation  
✅ Total, average, and percentage calculation  
✅ Overall grade evaluation  
✅ Recursive loop for multiple inputs  
✅ Input validation with clear user prompts

## 🧪 Subjects Evaluated

- 📘 **Physics**
- 🧪 **Chemistry**
- ➗ **Mathematics**

Each subject is graded based on the following scale:

| Marks Range | Grade |
|-------------|--------|
| 90 - 100    | O      |
| 80 - 89     | A+     |
| 70 - 79     | A      |
| 60 - 69     | B+     |
| 50 - 59     | B      |
| 40 - 49     | P      |
| < 40        | F      |
